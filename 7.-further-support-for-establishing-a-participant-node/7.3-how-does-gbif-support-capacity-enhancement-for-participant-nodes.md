# 7.3 How does GBIF support capacity enhancement for Participant nodes?

Capacity enhancement provides an essential foundation for the sustainable functioning and performance of the GBIF Participant network and all its members, regardless of their level of development. The [GBIF capacity enhancement framework](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80954) draws on recent advancement in the field of capacity development and access to research infrastructures to explain the overall approach taken by the GBIF network to programming activities in this area.  

The GBIF Participants and Secretariat have developed a range of capacity enhancement activities and programmes to empower all members of the GBIF community to carry out their work in the most effective, self-sustained and stable way. Capacity enhancement includes improving the way Participants can contribute to and benefit from GBIF, how they organize their work and how they relate to other Participants at regional and global scales. 

A [capacity enhancement support programme](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219/capacity-enhancement-support-programme) with an annual call for project proposals provides GBIF Participants with co-funding to address self-identified capacity needs through collaborative regional and international projects. These projects can combine a range of actions, including mentoring between Participant nodes, the organization of regional training workshops, the development or adaptation of documentation, GBIF advocacy actions and needs assessments. Participants are encouraged to consider developing project proposals to support the establishment and consolidation of their nodes in collaboration with experts from the GBIF network. Reviewing [past projects](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219/capacity-enhancement-support-programme) can provide some useful examples of how to structure collaborative actions aiming to establish new Participant nodes. 

GBIF also provides access to training opportunities for node managers and staff. GBIF-related training events are held all over the world and are displayed on the [events section](https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=event) of GBIF.org.
