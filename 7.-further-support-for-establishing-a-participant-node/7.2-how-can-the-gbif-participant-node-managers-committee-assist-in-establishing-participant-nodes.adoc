7.2 How can the GBIF Participant Node Managers Committee assist in establishing Participant nodes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=nodesCommittee[Participant Node Managers Committee] (often referred to as simply as 'the Nodes Committee') is a forum for sharing information and best practices between Participant nodes. It also https://www.gbif.org/document/80571[acts as an advisory committee] making recommendations to the other GBIF governing bodies. The committee comprises all Participant node managers, so as soon as a GBIF Participant has appointed a node manager, he or she is invited to take part in the committeeâ€™s activities.

The https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=nsg[Nodes Steering Group] (NSG) was established within the committee in 2011, consisting of the Chair and Vice Chairs of the Participant Node Managers Committee, and regional representatives from each of the six GBIF regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and Oceania). Its objectives include offering specific recommendations to the relevant GBIF bodies based on feedback provided by Participant nodes, and to provide advice on the GBIF Work Programme relevant to nodes.

The Nodes Committee meets in a Global Nodes Meeting every other year. These meetings, often combined with training activities, provide an excellent forum for interacting with other node managers and planning collaborative activities. In addition, many of the regional subcommittees organize Regional Nodes Meetings either annually or every other year. These meetings advance regional collaborative work between node managers and provide a forum for discussing priorities and opportunities within the region.

In between meetings, the committee communicates via mailing lists and teleconferences, also making use of the http://discourse.gbif.org/[GBIF community forum] and its thematic and language groups to support collaborative work. New Participant nodes are strongly encouraged to https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?group=nodesCommittee[contact members of the Nodes Committee] to get involved in its activities, access the expertise of the network and plan collaborative projects to support the establishment of Participant nodes.
