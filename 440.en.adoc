* Assisting data holders with data management, using appropriate tools and practices, such as the https://www.gbif.org/tools/data-validator[GBIF data validator], and through capacity development programmes focused on biodiversity informatics
* Acting as a permanent repository for biodiversity data within the Participantâ€™s domain for data holders that do not have the capacity to maintain their own permanent records
* Providing https://www.gbif.org/endorsement-guidelines[endorsement of biodiversity data publishers] to be added to the GBIF network
* Coordinating with other biodiversity-related initiatives to ensure maximum interoperability across biodiversity data types
