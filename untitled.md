# 4. What services do Participant nodes provide?

The specific responsibilities and services provided by each node vary considerably, depending in part on the Participant’s priorities for joining GBIF. Furthermore, some GBIF Participant nodes provide services that are delivered by separate biodiversity-related institutions in other countries and organizations. Nevertheless, the services and responsibilities of nodes can be broadly grouped into four main categories:

## 4.1. Supporting biodiversity data mobilization

Examples of services include: 

* Organizing biodiversity data within the Participant’s domain to ensure open access to all digitally available biodiversity data 
* Promoting and coordinating national investment in the digitization and mobilization of biodiversity information 
* Providing a technical infrastructure and support to enable biodiversity data to be published on the Internet and through the GBIF network \(including collections data, observational data, checklist data and metadata describing data sources\) 
* Promoting the benefits of data publishing, for example, through the use of [data papers](https://www.gbif.org/data-papers) as a mechanism to gain recognition for sharing of datasets 
* Developing a culture of open access and supporting open data requirements mandated, for example, through grant conditions 
* Maintaining a collaborative framework between data holders and users, for example, through data sharing agreements that enable data sharing to occur according to agreed terms and encourage data reuse 
* Promoting societal engagement in biodiversity issues, for example, by supporting citizen science movements that mobilize observational data 

## 4.2. Supporting biodiversity data management and curation 

Examples of services include: 

* Increasing the quality of available biodiversity data, for example, through the standardization and documentation of existing data sources with metadata 
* Assisting data holders with data management, using appropriate tools and practices, for example, through capacity development programmes focused on biodiversity informatics 
* Acting as a permanent repository for biodiversity data within the Participant’s domain for data holders that do not have the capacity to maintain their own permanent records 
* Providing endorsement of biodiversity data publishers to be added to the GBIF network 
* Coordinating with other biodiversity-related initiatives to ensure maximum interoperability across biodiversity data types. 

## 4.3. Supporting biodiversity data analysis and use 

Examples of services include: 

* Facilitating access to biodiversity data by promoting the use of the GBIF infrastructure and/or by maintaining a national or thematic biodiversity data portal 
* Acting as a reference institution for biodiversity information 
* Providing support for biodiversity research, through evaluation of data needs and data gaps, encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation between scientists and through capacity development activities 
* Providing support for the compilation, maintenance and publishing of national, sub-national and thematic species inventories and checklists, and the use of these lists to underpin other activities \(e.g., conservation work, national reporting\) 
* Providing support for policy by, for example, offering advice on the designation of biodiversity research priorities, and helping to mainstream the use of of biodiversity data and information in decision-making, planning, conservation and management 
* Providing support for national reporting on biodiversity, for example under the Convention on Biological Diversity and other multilateral biodiversity-related agreements

## 4.4. Coordinating the landscape of biodiversity-related initiatives including participating in the GBIF network 

Examples of services include: 

* Promoting the expansion of GBIF participation to other countries and organizations 
* Taking part in the GBIF Participant Node Managers Committee and regional sub-committees, by providing guidance on and contributing to the implementation of GBIF work programmes in line with Participant priorities 
* Benefiting from and contributing to capacity development activities across the network, such as mentoring, training, sharing of expertise through task groups, participation in collaborative projects, testing and advising on new developments from other Participants and the GBIF Secretariat 
* Coordinating communication activities relating to biodiversity information and informatics activities, sharing communications with the wider GBIF community through the Secretariat, and disseminating relevant global information to stakeholder networks within the node’s country or organization 
* Promoting synergies with national and regional activities involving other global biodiversity initiatives, such as the [CBD Clearing-House Mechanism](http://www.cbd.int/chm/default.shtml), IPBES capacity building programmes, Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library and others, including close liaison or joint working with relevant nodes or focal points for these initiatives
