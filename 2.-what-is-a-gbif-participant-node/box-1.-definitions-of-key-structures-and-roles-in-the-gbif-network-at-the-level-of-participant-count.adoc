*Key Structures*

*Participant*: a country, economy or organization that joins GBIF by signing a https://www.gbif.org/document/80661[Memorandum of Understanding] and establishing a co-ordinated effort to support open access and use of biodiversity data, to advance scientific research, and to promote technological and sustainable development. Participant node: a coordinating team designated by the Participant to establish, strengthen and expand the collective GBIF activities in the country or organization.

Biodiversity information facility: Variously described as a ‘BIF’, a system or a network, a broader structure of people and institutions, coordinated by the node, that collectively forms an infrastructure for delivering biodiversity information to relevant stakeholders.

Key Roles

*Delegation*: the team of people nominated by Participants to represent them in GBIF decision making, under the leadership of the Head of Delegation.

*Head of Delegation*: the person designated by the Participant to act as its representative to the https://www.gbif.org/governance[GBIF Governing Board] and take part in the global-level decision making.

*Node manager*: the person designated by the Participant to manage the activities of the node to coordinate a biodiversity information facility.

*Node staff*: the team of people working in a Participant node. They are usually focused on specific areas such as user support, scientific liaison or technical development.

*Biodiversity information facility stakeholders*: any person from within a Participant country or organization who contributes to the overall work of the biodiversity information facility or benefits from it. Some examples include publishers of biodiversity data, users of GBIF-mediated data (e.g. scientific researchers, planning agencies and the private sector) and policymakers involved in the development of data policies.
