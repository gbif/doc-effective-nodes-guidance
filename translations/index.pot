"The conservation and sustainable use of biological resources depend on an "
"understanding of biodiversity and the processes that underlie it. While 250 "
"years of biodiversity research and data collection have generated a wealth "
"of information, it is scattered across a multitude of sources and formats: "
"from museum collection specimens and local government reports to published "
"literature and university researchers’ own computers. On top of these "
"historical resources, today’s technological and scientific advances are "
"generating more data in huge quantities and fresh formats. Mobilizing this "
"information in a structured way while using common standards and common "
"platforms not only contributes to the understanding of biodiversity, but "
"also enables a vast range of uses, creates new research opportunities and "
"supports policymaking at the national and global levels."

"institutions with similar aims. The node should be able to work with all "
"relevant stakeholders, independently of any preferences or priorities that "

"A https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219[*capacity enhancement support "
"programme*] with an annual call for project proposals provides GBIF "
"Participants with co-funding to address self-identified capacity needs "
"through collaborative regional and international projects. These projects "
"can combine a range of actions, including mentoring between Participant "
"nodes, the organization of regional events and training workshops, the "
"development or adaptation of documentation, GBIF advocacy actions and "
"actions to promote data use. Participants are encouraged to consider "
"developing project proposals to support the establishment and consolidation "
"of their nodes in collaboration with experts from the GBIF "
"network. Reviewing https://www.gbif.org/programme/82219/[past projects] can "
"provide some useful examples of how to structure collaborative actions "
"aiming to establish new Participant nodes."
