"The conservation and sustainable use of biological resources depend on an "
"understanding of biodiversity and the processes that underlie it. While 250 "
"years of biodiversity research and data collection have generated a wealth "
"of information, it is scattered across a multitude of sources and formats: "
"from museum collection specimens and local government reports to published "
"literature and university researchers’ own computers. On top of these "
"historical resources, today’s technological and scientific advances are "
"generating more data in huge quantities and fresh formats. Mobilizing this "
"information in a structured way while using common standards and common "
"platforms not only contributes to the understanding of biodiversity, but "
"also enables a vast range of uses, creates new research opportunities and "
"supports policymaking at the national and global levels."

"This diversity of functions makes it clear that nodes require staff with a "
"wide range of skills ranging from administrative support to expertise in "
"biodiversity informatics. Deciding how to staff a node will, of course, "
"depend on its expected roles, the level of financial support and the hosting "
"agreement or institutional location of the node. In cases where nodes are "
"integrated into larger institutions, functions like administrative tasks are "
"often provided through in-kind support from the host. The institutional "
"landscape at the Participant level will affect the importance given to "
"particular skills: for example, where a node is coordinating a large number "
"of biodiversity-related institutions, it will need greater emphasis on "
"outreach and networking skills."
